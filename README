                ...
            }
        );
    
        my $model = RDF::Trine::Model->new;

DESCRIPTION
    aREF (another RDF Encoding Form <http://gbv.github.io/aREF/>) is an
    encoding of RDF graphs in form of arrays, hashes, and Unicode strings.
    This module implements methods for decoding from aREF data to RDF
    triples (RDF::aREF::Decoder) and for encoding RDF data in aREF
    (RDF::aREF::Encoder).

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
  decode_aref( $aref, [ %options ] )
    Decodes an aREF document given as hash reference with
    RDF::aREF::Decoder. Shortcut for
    "RDF::aREF::Decoder->new(%options)->decode($aref)".

  aref_query( $aref, [ $subject ], $query )
    Experimental query function to access parts of an aREF data structure.

SEE ALSO
    *   aREF is being specified at <http://github.com/gbv/aREF>.

    *   This module was first packaged together with Catmandu::RDF.

    *   RDF::Trine contains much more for handling RDF data in Perl.

    *   See RDF::YAML for a similar (outdated) RDF encoding in YAML.

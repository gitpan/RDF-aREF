DESCRIPTION
    aREF (another RDF Encoding Form <http://gbv.github.io/aREF/>) is an
    encoding of RDF graphs in form of arrays, hashes, and Unicode strings.
    This module provides methods for decoding from aREF data to RDF triples
    (RDF::aREF::Decoder), for encoding RDF data in aREF
    (RDF::aREF::Encoder), and for querying parts of an RDF graph
    (RDF::aREF::Query).

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
    The following functions are exported by default.

  decode_aref( $aref [, %options ] )
    Decodes an aREF document given as hash reference with
    RDF::aREF::Decoder. Equivalent to
    "RDF::aREF::Decoder->new(%options)->decode($aref)".

  encode_aref( $rdf [, %options ] )
    Create a new RDF::aREF::Encoder and construct an aREF subject map with
    RDF triples given as RDF::Trine::Model or RDF::Trine::Model::Iterator.

  aref_query( $graph, [ $origin ], $query )
    Query parts of an aREF data structure. See RDF::aREF::Query for details.

  aref_query_map( $graph, [ $origin ], $query_map )
    Map parts of an aREF data structure to a flat key-value structure.

This directory contains a test suite with test cases for aREF decoding. Each
example consists of an aREF document in JSON (with extension `.json`) and an
expected result, as RDF graph in form of canonical N-Triples (with extension
`.nt`) and/or sorted list of expected error message (with extension `.err`).
